# Welcome to My Academic Homepage

I am an archaeologist based in Athens, Greece. I am affiliated with both the Swedish Institute at Athens and the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. My main research focuses on Greek landscape archaeology, spatial analysis using computational approaches, prehistoric ceramics, cognitive archaeology and the prehistoric archaeology of Greece and the Aegean. I am particularly interested in exploring how past human communities conceptualised and interacted with their environment through spatial analysis and archaeological fieldwork. I am also interested in the long-term archaeology of Greek landscapes more generally, as well as human-sea interaction.
