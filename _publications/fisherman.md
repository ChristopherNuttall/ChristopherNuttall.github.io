## Abstract

The Fishermen Vase, a unique example of the Black and Red style pottery from Phylakopi, presents a detailed depiction of four male figures holding fish, rendered with striking naturalism and geometric cohesion. The iconography, featuring distinct anatomical proportions, stylized facial features, and intricate decorative elements, suggests a sophisticated artistic approach. Discovered near the ‘Pillar Crypt’ at Phylakopi, its stratigraphic context and stylistic characteristics place it within the Middle to Late Cycladic I period (Phylakopi II–III), though its extended use-life complicates precise dating. Comparative analysis highlights parallels with Minoan seals and the Fishermen frescoes from Akrotiri, raising questions about cross-cultural influences and thematic continuities in Aegean art. Interpretations of the scene range from a simple celebration of fishing to a ritual or social function, possibly linked to the symbolic importance of the depicted fish species. Despite its ambiguity, the Fishermen Vase stands as a remarkable and singular artifact within Aegean pictorial pottery, offering valuable insights into Cycladic artistic conventions, maritime engagement, and socio-cultural expressions.
