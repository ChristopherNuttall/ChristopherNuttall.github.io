## Abstract

This study explores the interrelation between settlement dynamics and coastal proximity during the Bronze Age in the Saronic Gulf, utilising an innovative spatial analytical approach. By integrating Geographic Information System (GIS) and statistical methods in R, this paper analyses a dataset comprising 258 archaeological sites across diverse coastal and inland environments. The methodology uses the Movecost package for R to calculate least-cost paths, quantifying the ease of access to coastlines, and enabling a nuanced interpretation of settlement patterns over time. Results indicate significant shifts in settlement patterns linked to socio-economic, climatic, and political changes. The early phases, particularly during Early Helladic II, show an increased distance from the coast, suggesting a period less reliant on maritime activities despite the existence of extensive maritime networks. Conversely, Early Helladic III and Middle Helladic III–Late Helladic II periods mark a more pronounced coastal orientation; in the first case, it was probably connected to climatic instability and survival strategies and, in the second one, connected to socio-political change and economic opportunities. The analysis challenges traditional views of constant coastal habitation. Instead, it reveals a complex pattern where coastal proximity was not solely dictated by maritime capabilities: it was a strategic choice influenced by a myriad of factors, including security, agricultural potential, external trade relations and climatic change. The rise and fall of Kolonna, a significant urban centre, underscores these dynamics, as shifts in its regional influence correlate with broader Aegean power structures and climatic events. This paper contributes to the understanding of how ancient societies adapted their settlement strategies in response to changing socio-political circumstances. It also demonstrates the potential of R and spatial statistics as powerful tools for archaeological inquiry, providing new perspectives on traditional interpretations of ancient settlement patterns.
