## Abstract

The spouted inturned‑rim bowls (SIRBs) from Phylakopi represent a significant typological and chronological sequence, offering insights into ceramic development from the Early Cycladic IIIB to the Late Cycladic periods. These vessels, characterized by their distinctive inturned rims and spouts, exhibit a wide range of fabric types, sizes, and decorative schemes, with their typology divided into three major forms (A, B, and C). The earliest type (A1), commonly known as the "Melian bowl," is notable for its combination of dark burnished and soft matt painted decoration, while later types (A2 and B) reflect a shift away from burnished surfaces and an increasing standardization in production. By the Late Cycladic I period, Type C bowls, produced on the fast wheel with pinched spouts and minimal decoration, illustrate a transition toward more streamlined and mass‑produced forms, potentially influenced by Minoan ceramic traditions. The stratigraphic distribution of these vessels suggests their persistence across multiple phases at Phylakopi, with early examples associated with local Cycladic traditions and later forms aligning with broader Aegean trends. Functional interpretations range from serving vessels for viscous liquids to containers used in storage contexts, and their evolving design may reflect changing consumption practices, particularly in response to the growing influence of Minoan ceramic preferences. Ultimately, the decline of the SIRB series in the Late Cycladic period appears to coincide with the increased adoption of Minoanising pottery at Phylakopi, highlighting broader shifts in ceramic production and cultural interactions within the prehistoric Aegean.
