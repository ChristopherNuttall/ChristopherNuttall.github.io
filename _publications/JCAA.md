## Abstract

This study introduces and operationalises the concept of Coastal Proximity Analysis (CPA), a methodological framework aimed at examining settlement patterns in relation to their coastal proximity. Utilising a combination of spatial analysis and archaeological survey data, the study scrutinises the prehistoric settlement patterns of three Greek islands—Kea, Kefalonia, and Kos—each representing major archipelagos and boasting extensive research histories. Their chronologies span from the Late Neolithic to the Late Bronze Age, offering a long-term perspective on human-coastscape interaction. The CPA methodology uses time values in minutes to express median distances to coastlines for sites within different chronological phases. Despite the limitations posed by chronological uncertainty and geographic coverage, the study reveals discernible trends in settlement patterns, each island showing unique preferences for higher or lower coastal proximity over time. The results suggest that the relationship between society and coastline varied based on various factors such as topography, cultural orientation, and external pressures such as climate change, foreign contact, and immigration. The paper underscores the utility of the CPA framework for decoding the complex interplay between environmental and human factors in shaping settlement patterns in insular environments.
