## Abstract

This article examines the complex relationship between mortuary landscapes and human activity in southwest Messenia during the Middle and Late Helladic periods (c. 2050–1190 BCE). Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analyses, the study investigates the spatial distribution and factors influencing the placement of tumuli and tholos tombs in the Messenian landscape. The results reveal distinct functions of MH tumuli as visible markers on the landscape, forming a network of landmarks connecting communities with shared values and beliefs. In contrast, LH I–II tholoi were strategically placed along movement routes, marking areas of interaction and control, or atop pre‑existing MH tumuli, also reflecting competing ideologies and a shift in symbolic power. During LH III, tholoi were located closer to settlements, emphasizing the social significance of political and territorial motivations. The study highlights the agency of mortuary landscapes in shaping cultural narratives and underscores the role of geopolitical control over land in selecting burial sites. The integration of GIS analyses enriches our understanding of past societies' perception of death and their connection to the landscape.
