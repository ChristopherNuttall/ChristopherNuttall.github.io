## Research Profile

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher based in Athens, Greece, at the **Swedish Institute at Athens** and the **National and Kapodistrian University of Athens**. My academic journey has consistently focused on the archaeology of prehistoric Greece and the Aegean, landscape archaeology, spatial analyses, and human-sea interactions. I have been particularly interested in how ancient populations interacted with their environments, especially coastal and island landscapes, using digital and archaeological methods to interpret past human behaviours and settlement patterns.

I earned my PhD from the **University of Uppsala**, Sweden, where my research employed a multi-variate and multi-scalar analysis of human-sea interactions on the Greek mainland, Aegean islands, and Crete from the Late Neolithic to the Late Bronze Age. Since then, my academic appointments have included roles as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow and Field Director on projects in Greece, where I've further expanded my work on islandscapes, maritime connectivity, human-sea interaction, and prehistoric ceramics.

## Fieldwork & Research Projects

My research and fieldwork experience has included a series of postdoctoral and postgraduate projects, as well as fieldwork involving archaeological surveys and excavations in various regions of Greece, notably on Crete, the Peloponnese, the Cyclades, and Boiotia. I have collaborated with international teams and contributed to interdisciplinary studies on prehistoric Greece. My ongoing research integrates spatial technology, ceramic analysis, and archaeological field methods to build a nuanced understanding of past societies, environment-human interactions, and the complexities of prehistoric Aegean communities. Below are more specific descriptions of my research projects.
